# Ularn Spoiler Guide

Adapted from Phil Cordier's web site:

## Lance of Death & Strategy

In Larn, the basic strategy was to get enough money to buy a Lance of Death,
usually by getting to dungeon level 10, killing or getting around the demon
lord, and getting and then selling the Eye of Larn. This would usually get
you enough money to buy the Lance from the dnd store. You could then go into
the volcano and kill everything in sight with one hit from the Lance.
Well, the Lance is still deadly to all monsters. Demons, on the other hand,
are merely tickled. And there are a LOT more demons (and relatives) in Ularn
than in Larn.

## Dungeon and Volcano levels

There are now 15 levels to the Dungeon, and 5 to the Volcano. Larn had 10
and 3.

Levels 11 - 15 of the dungeon contain, in addition to all the other nasty
monsters that show up at low levels:
- level 11: 1 demon lord
- level 12: 2 demon lords
- level 13: 3 demon lords
- level 14: 4 demon lords
- level 15: 5 demon lords + 1 demon prince guarding the Eye of Larn.

Levels 1 - 5 of the Volcano contain:
- level 1: 1 demon prince
- level 2: 2 demon princes
- level 3: 3 demon princes
- level 4: 4 demon princes
- level 5: 5 demon princes + 1 God of Hellfire guarding the potion of cure
dianthroritis.

In addition, there are no stairs from level 3 to 4, or from 4 to 5. The only
way to go down is via a pit or trap door. There is guaranteed at least 1
bottomless pit and bottomless trap door on level 5. The rock on levels 3, 4,
and 5 cannot be destroyed via a vaporize rock spell, or in any other way.

## Magic Items

Many of the following magic items will appear in the game:

#### Eye of Larn

The Eye now has a very beneficial magic property. If you are carrying the
Eye, demon lords, demon princes, and the God of Hellfire are visible to you.
Otherwise, they are invisible. They will show as follows:

Monster Character on screen
- Type I Demon Lord: 1
- Type II DemonLord: 2
- Type III Demon Lord: 3
- Type IV Demon Lord: 4
- Type V Demon Lord: 5
- Type VI Demon Lord: 6
- Type VII Demon Lord: 7
- Demon Prince: 9
- God of Hellfire: 0

#### Sword of Slashing
The Sword of Slashing is quite strong and light, and is impervious to rust.
It raises dexterity by 5.

#### Bessman's Flailing Hammer
The Hammer is the strongest weapon in the game (excluding the Lance of
Death). It lowers your intelligence by 10, but raises your dexterity and
strength by 10.

#### Orb of Enlightenment
Carrying the Orb gives permanent expanded awareness.

#### Orb of Dragon Slaying
Causes attacks against dragons to be much more effective.

#### Scarab of Negate Spirit
Spirit Nagas and Poltergeists damage is halved if you have the Scarab of
Negate spirit.

#### Amulet of Invisibility
Causes the 'inv' spell to last much longer. Also extends see invisible while
being carried.

#### Cube of Undead Control
Vampires, Wraiths, and Zombies damage is halved you have the Cube of Undead
Control. In addition, they can perform no special attacks upon you, like
draining your experience level.

#### Device of Theft Prevention
If you have this, Nymphs and Disenchantresses cannot steal anything from
you.

#### Brass Lamp
A genie lives in the brass lamp. If you are lucky, by rubbing the lamp, the
genie will grant you a spell. Be warned though, the genie does not usually
like to be disturbed, and may react unpleasantly. If the genie disappears
(along with the lamp) without granting you a wish, it is still possible to
find him again. But if you are granted a wish, the genie will not wish to be
disturbed again (you only get one wish).

#### Hand of Fear
Causes the scare monster spell to last much longer.

#### Talisman of the Sphere
Normally, demons can dispel spheres of annihilation, disenchantresses can
cancel them, and if you have the spell 'cancel' cast, that may cancel the
sphere too. You can also die by touching the sphere.
Carrying the Talisman revokes all of the above

#### Wand of Wonder
You will not fall down any pits or trap doors if you are carrying the Wand
of Wonder.

#### Staff of Power
Carrying the staff of power will cancel any attack by a demon lord,
demon prince, wraith, or vampire 75% of the time. It increases wisdom by 10.

#### Slayer
Demon lords and demon princes attacks are halved if you are carrying the sword
Slayer. Slayer essentially acts as a Lance of Death, but only against
demons. It is otherwise a good strong weapon against other monsters. You
will only find Slayer somewhere below dungeon level 10, or in the volcano.
It increases intelligence by 10.

#### Elven Chain
Strong and light, impervious to rust.

## New spell
I've added a 'make wall' spell, that creates a wall in the place you
specify. The code is 'mkw'.

## Elevators

Watch out for express elevators. They can be good or bad, depending on which
direction they go (up or down).

## Time limit

The time limit for solving the game has been increased from 300 mobuls to
400 mobuls.

## Dealer McDope's
On request from several unsavory types here at UC Santa Cruz, I added Dealer
McDope's Pad. He will show up usually somewhere in the lower level of the
dungeon. Visiting Dealer McDope's will offer you the chance to buy such
interesting and stimulating items as:
- Killer Speed
- Groovy Acid
- Monster Hash
- Trippy Shrooms
- Cool Coke

You "use" a drug by dropping it, and then moving on top of it for more
instructions. Drugs have varied effects. They can be fun, but are generally
not worth the trouble.

## NOTES
- NEVER NEVER cast 'vpr' when you are next to an altar!
- Interesting things may happen when you sit on a dead throne.
