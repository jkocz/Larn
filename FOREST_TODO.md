- General:
    - Re-evaluate time limit
    - Amiga graphics?
    - Need additional maps (even if only slight variations). Then ensure maps only used once.
    - Post potion, store opens up with new items (some new, some like Slashing/Vorpal?)
    - Stairs in addition to going further in? (If stairs, could be for special items?)
    - No teleportation traps in forest

- Monsters/balance:
    - Monster color is an optional button?
    - Make e.g. hellhound immune to fire? 
    - Some monsters need to move faster than Our Hero (just guardians, or all?)
    - Make guardians invisible without eye of larn
    - Addition of other stats when fighting monsters - in particular guardians+
    - Must have high wis/int to solve puzzle of mark?
    - Make alters in Ularn more dangerous? (too easy to get high stats?)
    - Make alters crumble more easily?
    - Master can cast spells from a distance
    - P doesn't attack on edge
              
- Spells:
    - GEN and 1) Dragons, 2) Guardian/App/Master
    - Rebound should not be permanent


- Combining options:
    - New results from inventive combinations

- Other items:
    - Life crown
    - Replace Alters with Totems or similar? 

- Out and out bugs:
    - Ularn bug: Make stairs always take you to same place
    - Creator only sees full map of map where level gained
    - Store opens again if not carry potion - make "Have potion" permanent (similar to have mark).
