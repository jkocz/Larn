- General:
    - ~~Make sure slayer/other items that only appear out of dungeon are still forced to appear in the volcano~~
    - Re-evaluate time limit
    - Keep or remove longer text display? - Need to update in shops/bank/home if keep.
    - ~~Test amulet of invisibility~~
    - ~~Change slayer probability so it appears on V5 (or F1?) if not already?~~
    - Amiga graphics?
    - ~~Forest maps need updating to be distinct~~ 
    - Need additional maps (even if only slight variations). Then ensure maps only used once.

- Monsters/balance:
    - Make e.g. hellhound immune to fire? 
    - ~~Increase monster damage in Forest~~
    - ~~Increase monster toughness in Forest~~
    - ~~Increase monster experience in Forest~~
    - ~~Guardians drain~~
    - ~~Guardian reduce HP~~
    - ~~Guardians resistant to scare~~
    - Some monsters need to move faster than Our Hero
    - Make guardians invisible without eye of larn
    - Addition of other stats when fighting monsters - in particular guardians+
    - ~~Reduce monster spawn rate in forest (at last forest level, is almost impossible to move due to monsters)~~
    - Make alters in Ularn more dangerous? (too easy to get high stats?)
    - Make alters crumble more easily?
    - ~~Too hard to hit master~~
    - Master can cast spells from a distance
              
- Spells:
    - ~~Complete Rebound~~
    - ~~Should rebound also reflect special attacks?~~ (No, should be cancelled with can/staff)
    - ~~Fix spell display for status effects (display.js)~~
    - ~~Genie cannot grant forest spells~~ (enable for com/por?)
    - ~~Master dispells sphere even with talisman~~
    - ~~BRK and Mirrors~~
    - GEN and 1) Dragons, 2) Guardian/App/Master
    - ~~WTW should not work in forest~~

- Combining options:
    - New results from inventive combinations

- Other items:
    - Life crown

- Out and out bugs:
    - ~~Teleporting in volcano level 4 took into forest level 1 (multiple times)~~
    - ~~Combine breaks stats? (need to drop and pickup again for it to work?/create new item)~~
    - ~~Ularn scoreboard --> Forest scoreboard~~ (best way to incorporate Forest name throughout?)
    - ~~End of game "press return" in non-Forest mode.~~
    - Ularn bug: Vorpal blade sometimes beheads a monster that is killed by a spell.
      (use same logic as rustmonster to not behead?)
    - Ularn bug: Make stairs always take you to same place
