This branch is a simple attempt to extend the end of the game past the original and ULARN stories. 

This idea came about after viewing the "data" file, and observing that there were several higher tiers of character that were never likely to be accessed in the original game. It also seemed several of the character stats were largely underused. In "Forest" the idea is the character will reach the higher levels of the class, and that each of the character stats will have more meaning/importance.

This version keeps all of the hooks for AWS and the larn.org site, however, other than making use of the excellent code as a base, it is unaffiliated. It is designed to be played locally and it is not possible at this point to access a global scoreboard for Forest. 


At present, this is not even an alpha, let alone a beta, but comments and advice are always welcome!
