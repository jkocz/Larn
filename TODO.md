One thing that was askew in your initial implementation was flex: 95%
If you're only after flex-grow, use the property directly rather than through the shorthand flex. Then it becomes easier to spot that flex-grow doesn't take % in but relative integer weights (1, 2, 3...)

ULARN 12.5.0:
- update README.spoilers doc

- search for ULARN TODO
- "you have found" vs "you find"
- check all 1.6.3 code
- prevent wield and wear at the same time
- should running increase gtime?
- explain that . drops gold
- should smart monsters be able to walk around sleeping monsters?
- when blind, killing a monster shouldn't reveal gold dropped, or anything else?
- retro font mode isn't properly monospaced in mac/safari

  - make buying / selling items etc faster 
- eye of larn pickup/drop message with proper naps inbetween messages (harder than expected the first time around)
- repeat function
- move command


bugs:
* lots of monsters walking through wall. (fixed?)
  - was this due to smart ripple[] not being cleared?
* fall down pit, area around player isn't exposed
   - only when player doesn't fall down on the first 'try'
* long user names aren't truncated on the start screen
- closing a door (from on top of the door) when a monster is in the spot you were
  just in drops you back on the monsters spot. the monster reappears when you move.
- can't load game stats from local scoreboard (can't find game sdkjfhsdfkj)
- arrow buttons on help screen are truncated in amiga mode
- amiga mode: strikethrough missing on taxes owing after victory
- blindness
  - black tile when opening door when blind
  - when blind, a monster from an unknown tile will reveal the tile its standing on during attack

hardmode ideas:
- can only wield actual weapons
- prevent wield and wear at the same time
- altar donation aren't just 10%, min 50
- stop time doesn't prevent falling in pits
- demons don't respect stealth, hold is less effective
- guardians are never asleep
- reduce blessed ularn item sale prices
