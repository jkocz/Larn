- game start/end stats
- show other actions ("you have desecrated at the altar!" etc)
- give notification given when haste, aggravate monsters subsides (no?)
- beep support
- speedrun mode
- repeat function
- move command

bugs:
* lots of monsters walking through wall. (fixed?)
  - was this due to smart ripple[] not being cleared?
* fall down pit, area around player isn't exposed
   - only when player doesn't fall down on the first 'try'
* long user names aren't truncated on the start screen
- brief flash of some other font when starting game
- fix interactions between haste self / haste monster / half-speed monsters (check 1.6.3 hastestep)
  * HAS + PER bug slow monsters (H,x,r,etc) move every moves, or totally paralyzed?
  - monster.isSlow, and different way to decide when to move
  - half speed monster should move at full speed with haste monster on
- closing a door (from on top of the door) when a monster is in the spot you were
  just in drops you back on the monsters spot. the monster reappears when you move.
- can't load game stats from local scoreboard (can't find game sdkjfhsdfkj)
- arrow buttons on help screen are truncated in amiga mode
- amiga mode: strikethrough missing on taxes owing after victory
- blindness
  - black tile when opening door when blind
  - when blind, a monster from an unknown tile will reveal the tile its standing on during attack
  - when blind, killing a monster shouldn't reveal gold dropped, or anything else?
  - rothe/poltergeist/vampire are born awake -> should they move during stealth?
- monster movement isn't shown after falling asleep
- casting sph twice in the same direction will always kill the player

hardmode ideas:
- can only wield actual weapons
- prevent wield and wear at the same time
- altar donation aren't just 10%, min 50
- stop time doesn't prevent falling in pits
- demons don't respect stealth, hold is less effective
- guardians are never asleep
- reduce blessed ularn item sale prices
